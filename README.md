Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization Simulation
Overview
This repository documents my participation in the Data Analytics and Visualization simulation at Accenture North America. The simulation focused on advising a hypothetical social media client by leveraging data analysis techniques to uncover valuable insights for strategic decision-making.

Key Achievements
Dataset Analysis: Conducted in-depth analysis on 7 diverse datasets related to social media content trends. Explored data cleaning, preprocessing, and modeling to extract meaningful insights.

Client Advisory: Utilized data-driven findings to provide actionable recommendations to the hypothetical social media client. The analysis aimed to inform strategic decisions and enhance the client's understanding of content trends.

Presentation Skills: Developed a compelling PowerPoint deck and video presentation to effectively communicate key insights. Tailored the content for both the client and internal stakeholders, ensuring clarity and impact.
